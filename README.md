# Introduction
The A* algorithm, or A-star algorithm, is a widely used heuristic search algorithm for graph search and pathfinding. It is a general-purpose algorithm used to find the shortest or optimal path from a starting node to a target node. A* algorithm combines the principles of Dijkstra's algorithm for unweighted graph search and the greedy algorithm for heuristic search to improve search efficiency.  
Here's how the A* algorithm works:

# Usage
The code demonstrates two path planning algorithms, A* and JPS, along with a comparison of their planning times. Here are the steps for running the code.

**1、Download Code**
```
git clone https://github.com/xiaoruoxu/Astar_ws
```
**2、Compile**
```
cd ~/Astar_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
**3、Run The Code**
```
roslaunch grid_path_searcher demo.launch
```
